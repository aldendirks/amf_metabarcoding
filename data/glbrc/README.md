This directory contains agronomic data from the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center. The formatted data files are `anpp.csv` (aboveground net primary productivity), `height.csv` (switchgrass height and lodging status), `soil.csv` (soil pH, phosphorus content, and cation exchange capacity), and `yield.csv` (switchgrass yield).
